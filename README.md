Space-Saver Folding Rack (3D Prototype)

A high-fidelity, web-based 3D visualization of the Space-Saver Vertical Fold Rack. This project demonstrates a compact urban storage solution designed to address space constraints in modern living environments.

🌟 Project Overview

This prototype visualizes a portable drying rack that features vertically folding wooden arms, a 360° rotating head, and an integrated thermal LED lamp for accelerated drying. The web application allows users to interact with the model in real-time, toggling mechanical states and inspecting internal components.

🎯 Problem Statement

Lack of Space: Urban living areas are shrinking, making traditional racks impractical.

Bulky Storage: Conventional racks are hard to hide when not in use.

Fixed/Irreplaceable: Heavy units that cannot be easily moved or repaired.

💡 Proposed Solution

Vertical Folding Mechanism: Arms fold down flush against the central pole.

Thermal Drying: Integrated LED heat source to speed up drying.

Portable: Battery-powered and lightweight design.

✨ Key Features

Interactive 3D Model: Fully navigable 3D scene (Zoom, Pan, Rotate).

Mechanical Simulation:

Folding Arms: Click to lift arms from vertical (storage) to horizontal (active) positions.

LED Lamp: Toggle the high-intensity thermal lamp with volumetric light beams and realistic glow effects.

Component Inspection: "Exploded View" mode separates the model into its core assemblies (Base, Pole, Arms, Lamp) with floating labels.

Responsive UI: A modern, dark-themed interface built with Tailwind CSS.
